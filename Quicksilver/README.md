# Kiwi actions for Quicksilver

[Quicksilver](http://qsapp.com) is an application launcher among other things. These Kiwi actions allow you to easily post to Kiwi directly from Quicksilver. 

* **Kiwi - Compose Post**: When you enter into Quicksilver's text input mode, this action will be available to you. All the text that you type into the action will get passed along into a new post created in Kiwi. 

* **Kiwi - Post Now**: This service is the same as the *Compose Post* action. However, the post will be sent directly to App.net without giving you the option to edit the post first in Kiwi. 

* **Kiwi - Post Image**: When you add an image to the file buffer in Quicksilver, you will have the option to run this action that will send the image to Kiwi. Kiwi will upload the image to the cloud and insert the resulting cloud url into a new post. 


## Installation

To install the Quicksilver actions, you will need to copy the `.scpt` files from this repository into **<Home>/Library/Application Support/Quicksilver/Actions**. You will need to restart Quicksilver before you will be able to use these new actions.
