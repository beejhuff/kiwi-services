# Kiwi actions for Launchbar

[Launchbar](http://www.obdev.at/products/launchbar/index.html) is an application launcher among other things. These Kiwi extensions allow you to easily post to Kiwi directly from Launchbar. 

* **Kiwi - Compose Post**: When you use this Launchbar action, all the text that you type into the action will get passed along into a new post created in Kiwi. 

* **Kiwi - Post Now**: This service is the same as the *Compose Post* action. However, the post will be sent directly to App.net without giving you the option to edit the post first in Kiwi. 

* **Kiwi - Post Image**: When you add images to the file buffer in Launchbar, you will have the option to run this action that will send each image to Kiwi. Kiwi will upload each image to the cloud and insert the resulting urls in a new post. 


## Installation

To install the Launchbar actions, you will need to copy the `.scpt` files from this repository into **<Home>/Library/Scripts**. Launchbar should automatically index these files and they should be available for you to use fairly quickly.
