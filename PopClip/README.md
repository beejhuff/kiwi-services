# Kiwi extensions for PopClip

[PopClip](http://jwurl.net/13QDcq0) brings the smart contextual menus that we have become familiar with on iOS to the Mac. This Kiwi extension allows you to easily post to Kiwi directly from PopClip. 

* **To compose a post** simply select text in any application and click on Kiwi icon in PopClip. This extension will grab the selected text and create a new post in Kiwi.  

* **To post immediately** follows the same way as composing a post. However, if you hold down the âŒ˜(cmd) key while you click on the Kiwi icon, then the post will be sent directly to App.net without giving you the option to edit the post first in Kiwi. 

* **To post an image** select the text that is the full path to the image. The extension will recognize this as the path and an image and instead of simply posting the text, the image will be sent to Kiwi. Kiwi will upload the image to the cloud and insert the resulting cloud url into a new post.
