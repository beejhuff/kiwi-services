# Kiwi destination for Dropzone

[Dropzone](http://jwurl.net/13QD4Xu) is a nice automation tool with drag and drop capabilities. The Kiwi destination allows you to easily post text and images to App.net with Kiwi. 

There are a few different ways to trigger the Kiwi destination. 

* **Click**: When you click on the Kiwi destination, the contents from the clipboard will be added to a new post in Kiwi. 

* **Drag & Drop text**: Pretty simple, drag some text onto the Kiwi destination, and it will be added to a new post in Kiwi. 

* **Drag & Drop images**: You can drag one or more images onto the Kiwi destination, and each image will be sent to Kiwi. They will be uploaded to the cloud and insert the resulting urls in a new post. 


## Installation

To install the Dropzone destination, simply double click on the `kiwi.dropzone` file from this repository. Dropzone will take care of the rest. Enjoy!
