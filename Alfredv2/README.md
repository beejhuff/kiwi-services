# Kiwi extensions for Alfred v2

[Alfred](http://www.alfredapp.com) is an application launcher among other things. This Kiwi workflow for Alfred v2 allows you to easily post to Kiwi directly from Alfred. 

**NOTE**: These extensions will only work with Alfred v2. There are different extensions if you are running Alfred v1. 

* **Kiwi - Compose Post**: When you use this Alfred action, all the text that you type into the action will get passed along into a new post created in Kiwi. The default keyboard trigger for this action is `k`.

* **Kiwi - Post Now**: This service is the same as the *Compose Post* action. However, the post will be sent directly to App.net without giving you the option to edit the post first in Kiwi. The default keyboard trigger for this action is `k!`.

* **Kiwi - Post Image**: When you add images to the file buffer in Alfred, you will have the option to run this action that will send each image to Kiwi. Kiwi will upload each image to the cloud and insert the resulting urls in a new post. 


## Installation

To install the Alfred extensions, simply double click on the `Kiwi.alfredworkflow` file from this repository. Alfred will take care of the rest. Enjoy!
