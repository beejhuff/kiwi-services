# Kiwi Extension for Safari

The Kiwi extension for Safari allows you to easily create posts on App.net with [Kiwi](http://kiwi-app.net). There are 2 ways to access the extension. 

## Menu Bar

When you click on the Kiwi button on the menu bar, a new post will be created in Kiwi. The content of the post will be different depending on whether or not text is selected in the browser. 

* **When text is selected**, the content of the post created in Kiwi will contain that selected text along with the url to the webpage. 
* **When nothing is selected**, the content of the post created in Kiwi will contain the browser title along with the url to the webpage.

## Contextual Menu

* **Kiwi - Post Text**: This behaves exactly like the menu bar button does. When text is selected, it along with the page url are added to the post content.  When nothing is selected (simply right clicking on the page) then the page title and url get added to the post.
